          Growing up, I was always fascinated by technology and how it shapes
          the world. This curiosity led me to pursue a career in tech.
          Currently, I’m deepening my knowledge at Altschool, where I’ve been
          honing my skills in frontend development for over a month.

      <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool</h2>
      <p>
        I joined AltSchool Software Engineering to strengthen my foundation in
        software development, gain hands-on experience with industry-relevant
        tools and technologies, and expand my expertise beyond frontend
        development into backend and mobile development. I also wanted to
        network with like-minded individuals, collaborate on impactful projects,
        and prepare myself to contribute to innovative, real-world solutions in
        the global tech industry.
